# Customer-Segmentation-for-Marketing-Strategy
This Project was done as part of my Data Science Course.

#Problem Statement
Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the companyâ€™s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

Here is the requirement of a retail company - to segment the customers based on the total amount they spent so the company can market particular products based on the customer's expenditure level to maximise the sales and ROI(Return on Investment)
